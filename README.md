## What is this repo?
The subsections of this repo are various assignments I completed during 
Comp20, the Tufts Web Development course.

## Which is my favorite?
Landmarks, by far. But, not the front end side of it - writing the server side
is what interested me most: interacting with the mongo instance running on my
herokuapp, parsing that data, and accepting user data.

## How far I've come...
Coming into this class, I had only the most bare knowledge of html and css -
javascript and server-side programming were non-existent in my head. 
Comparatively, I'm now comfortable with all of the above, with a rudimentary
understanding of security concerns and nodejs server management, as well as
knowing my way around tools like heroku and mongodb.

## Where do I want to go from here?
Delve deeper into issues of security and web engineering - familiarize myself
with other professional frameworks such as angular, react, bootstrap, maybe php?
